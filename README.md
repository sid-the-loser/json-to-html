# json-to-html
This is a dumb project to convert a json file to html file.
I don't think I'll document this project, but you'll understand everything from the exmaples provided as: "test.json" and "test.json.html".
OK, its getting late...good night...

## issue
- Can't really have two similar tags. For example: {"body":{"h1":"hello world", "h1":"hello"}}, this will only allow one of last H1 tags value to pass through, ie, "hello" (Fix will be uploaded before 23rd March)
